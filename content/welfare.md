## Sexual health

Free sexual health services are available in Cambridge. Information on STIs, contraception, safety and sexual misconduct are provided below. You can find more services [here](https://www.studentadvice.cam.ac.uk/welfare/sexualhealth/).

### Safe sex and contraception:

All forms of contraception are available for free in the UK. Help on choosing contraception can be found on the [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/sexual-health/) and [FPA](https://www.fpa.org.uk/) websites or you can speak with a doctor at your GP practice or [local sexual health clinic](https://www.icash.nhs.uk/where-to-go/icash-cambridgeshire/lime-tree-clinic-cambridge).

Free condoms  can be found in the main college toilets. They are stocked by the welfare officer. If they are running low let us know [dcsa_welfare AT darwin.cam.ac.uk]. [CUSU](https://www.cusu.co.uk/) also provide condoms, including latex-free, female condoms and dental dams.

Free pregnancy test from DCSA Welfare officers or [CUSU](https://www.cusu.co.uk/) can also be requested to your pigeonhole in an unmarked envelope. If you find that you are pregnant, there are several options – find more information here. Remember that, whether you choose to continue or terminate your pregnancy, there is support for you should you need it. You can contact the DCSA Welfare officers, the [Dean/your tutor](https://www.darwin.cam.ac.uk/college-offices), or [CUSU](https://www.cusu.co.uk/). The University can grant you an intermission in your coursework for maternity leave or medical reasons if you need it to complete your degree.


The [NHS help page](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/sexual-health/getting-contraception/) and/or [iCASH](https://www.icash.nhs.uk/) have details and contacts for free emergency contraceptive pill or fitting the emergency intrauterine device (IAD). You can also contact the [Lime Tree Clinic](https://www.icash.nhs.uk/where-to-go/icash-cambridgeshire/lime-tree-clinic-cambridge), your GP and some Cambridge Pharmacies if you are registered with a Cambridge GP.


### Sexual health checks
Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) can happen to anyone who has had sex. Regular sexual health check-ups are important even if you are not experiencing symptoms.
The local sexual health clinic, providing confidential support, advice and treatment is the [Lime Tree Clinic](https://www.icash.nhs.uk/where-to-go/icash-cambridgeshire/lime-tree-clinic-cambridge).  If you think you may have been exposed to HIV, through unprotected penetrative or oral sex, it is possible to receive a drug treatment that will reduce your chances to develop the disease. Contact the Lime Tree Clinic for advice. Welfare officers and CUSU also organise sexual health screenings. Details will be advertised on the DCSA calendar and WhatsUp mailing list.

### Safety and sexual assault

It is very important that the College is safe for all members. Darwin college and Cambridge University have a [zero tolerance policy on sexual misconduct](https://www.cam.ac.uk/news/university-of-cambridge-launches-campaign-to-promote-zero-tolerance-of-sexual-misconduct). Darwin college procedure for handling cases of harassment and sexual misconduct are outline [here](https://www.darwin.cam.ac.uk/sites/default/files/Darwin%20College%20Harassment%20and%20Sexual%20Misconduct%20Guidelines%20and%20Procedures.pdf)

#### Sexual assault

If you have been a victim of sexual assault, call 999. There are specially trained police officers who can assist you and support you in reporting a sexual offence, collecting the necessary evidence and arrange for medical help if required.
