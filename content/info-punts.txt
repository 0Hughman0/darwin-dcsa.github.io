NOTE:
I used a dirty hack to make the /punts/ link appear expanded and viewable at the facilities link, by simply setting the details option to open for the punts section - unfortunately there is no other easy way to do this for the details section. I promise this is only case where I have done that. Unfortunately, at the time of writing this, it's very hard to do this differently, might be a reason not to use details in the future.

In order to update the punts page, you have to copy over the content from the facilities page and simply modify two lines:
- the details tag (setting the option to open):
`<details open>
  <summary><strong>Punting</strong></summary>`
- the link (updating to punts):
`permalink: /punts/`

Don't modify the punts.md file, instead make all changes to the facilities.md page and then just copy that over and make the above changes.
