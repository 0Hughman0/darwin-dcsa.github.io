The music society owns a wide range of equipment available for use by any Darwinian. These are stored in the Darwin College Bar Cellar. In there we have a drum kit, PA system, amps, a guitar, a bass, music stands - all sorts of goodies that we want you to make use of. If you think we’re missing something, we have money to buy stuff too!</p>

The college also has the Common Room for use as a rehearsal space. We have a blanket booking on Sundays, 12-7pm. If you would like to reserve a time-slot, get in touch with the committee, or come to a Jam (Weds 7-9pm).</p>

<p align="justify">
Finally we have 4 pianos available to play. In the Old Library we have an electric piano with headphones and an upright.
In the common room we have an upright and in the dining hall there is a grand. It is possible to reserve practice
sessions on the pianos in the Old Library and the Dining Room in advance. This can be booked through the Domestic

<h4>Booking a Punt</h4>

<p align="justify">
Current members of the college, including staff, and alumni can book a punt for a single outing of up to 3h each day in return for a £10 fee. Punts can be booked on the day or in advance and are allocated on a first-come, first-served basis. Weekends are the busiest and booking in advance is strongly recommended. During the week you will usually be able to take a punt out without booking in advance - but it is still recommended to avoid disappointment.
Trips down The Backs (to Jesus Green and back) typically take between a couple of hours depending on punting experience. Trips to Grantchester and back take 4 to 5 hours on average. The fee for trips to Grantchester is £20 per punt for non-members.
</p><br>

<strong>For students & college members with a raven log in</strong><br>
<p align="justify">
Log in to the <a href="http://dcsa.dar.cam.ac.uk/booked/Web/">online booking form</a>.
Punts can be reserved up to 7 days in advance, each person is permitted to make one reservation per day lasting 3 hours. Log in to the portal to see the availability of the punts. To make a booking, click on an available time slot. The ‘Create a new reservation’ page will then open. Enter your chosen time, under name of booking enter your full name and CRSID eg John Smith (jrs82), then ‘Create’. The booking should then appear under the schedule, payment must be made in cash when you arrive at the porter’s lodge to pick up the keys at the start of the booking. For trips to Grantchester, if multiple punts are required or other non-standard booking please contact the Admiral of the Punts.
</p><br>

<strong>For alumni without a raven log in</strong><br>
<p align="justify">

</p><br>

<h4>Full Membership</h4>
<p align="justify">
Current members of the college, including staff, and alumni can join the punt club for a non-refundable £30 fee. Membership is valid for the current season (March-November), or if purchased after Sept. 1st, until the end of the next years season. No discounts or refunds will be given for members arriving mid-season, or leaving before the season ends. The membership entitles you to unlimited, free punting (for up to 3h a day) as well as exclusive access to the four 1-person kayaks, one 2-person kayak, and 3-person canoe.

Learning how to punt
The club runs free punting lessons throughout Freshers’ Fortnight at the start of the academic year and are the best opportunity to learn the basics of punting on the Cam. If you cannot attend one of the punting lessons or decide you want to try punting at a later time of the year, please email the Admiral of the Punts at dcsa_punts@darwin.cam.ac.uk who may be able to organise punting lessons on demand throughout the academic year.
