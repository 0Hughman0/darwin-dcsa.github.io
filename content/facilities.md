  <summary><strong>DarBar</strong></summary>

<h3>DarBar</h3>
<p align="justify">
Without doubt the best college bar in Cambridge, the student-run and operated DarBar offers a space every day from 9pm to unwind after a busy day or to celebrate the end of the week. It offers a wide selection of drinks - both alcoholic and not - and it caters for every taste.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Keeping prices low is the priority for the DarBar team, and regular promotions operate throughout the year. The newly-christened Secession Session runs every Monday and offers deals even when the UK parliament refuses to do so. Also popular are the regular themed whisky tastings, where DarBar invites an expert to guide us through the quagmire that is whisky.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The bar’s most popular event is the annual Oktoberfest, where the official Munich Oktoberfest beers are imported and served in Darwin steins alongside live German music, sausages, and schnitzel.
</p>

<p align="justify">
During Freshers’ Fortnight the bar will be hosting numerous events, including a Gin Night, Latin Party, Board Game Night, the annual Derek Scott Bar Games Night (named after our Head Porter), a pub quiz, International Beer Night, open mic night, and the biggest event of them all, the BOP.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The bar relies on the student body to open every night. If you would like to be part of helping run one of the best
parts of Darwin College student life or if you have any questions about the bar, please email the Bar Chair at dcsa_bar AT darwin.cam.ac.uk. Stay up to date with the latest updates by liking our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/darwincollegebar">facebook page</a>!

<h3>Gym</h3>
<p align="justify">
Darwin offers access to a fitness room for primary or associated members of the college. The membership is free and allows you to use the gym at any time. In order to gain access to the gym for the first time you will be required to attend a gym induction, which will typically be offered during freshers’ week or can be individually arranged with your Sports & Societies officers (dcsa_sports AT darwin.ac.uk) throughout the year. This induction is important to familiarise yourself with the rules, ask any questions you might have, sign the conditions of use form and finally activate your student card for access to the gym. Please respect the following rules and guidelines:
</p>

<strong>RULES</strong><br>
<p align="justify">
The maximum capacity of the gym is 4 people. Enter the CRSIDs of all users for booking.
If the ergs are in use, no more than two people may be doing weights.
The squat rack and ergs must not be used at the same time.
</p>

<strong>GUIDELINES</strong><br>
<p align="justify">
Please be considerate of sudden noises while others are using the gym.
Walk-in sessions are allowed, but priority is given to those who book in advance.
Please use spotters when lifting weights.
</p>

  <summary><strong>Music</strong></summary>

<h3>Music at Darwin</h3>

<p align="justify">
The music society owns a wide range of equipment available for use by any Darwinian. These are stored in the Darwin College Bar Cellar. In there we have a drum kit, PA system, amps, a guitar, a bass, music stands - all sorts of goodies that we want you to make use of. If you think we’re missing something, we have money to buy stuff too!</p>

<p align="justify">
The college also has the Common Room for use as a rehearsal space. We have a blanket booking on Sundays, 12-7pm. If you would like to reserve a time-slot, get in touch with the committee, or come to a Jam (Weds 7-9pm).</p>

<p align="justify">
Finally we have 4 different pianos throughout the college. Please refer to the table below for info on where to find them and how/if to book. (Note: Keys for the rooms may be obtained from the Porters’ Lodge and must be returned before 11.30pm.)

<p align="justify">
We have a set of additional rules to account for the requirements of social distancing at this time. Please make sure to carefully read those before going on an outing.

A quick summary (not comprehensive), you are still expected to read the full Terms and Conditions before signing up!
<ul>
<li>A single outing can last up to 3h, a punt member can either take out 2 single kayaks or paddle boards at any one time or a single punt, canoe, or double kayak. If multiple punts are required or other non-standard bookings please contact the Admiral of the Punts.</li>
<li>A trip to Grantchester in the punt counts at least as two outings (lasts at least 4h+), thus requiring two bookings. A member can only make a single booking per day, so you will need at least two members/outings to go to Grantchester. You’ll need to be a group of students, in any case, to get the punt over the ramp, and <strong>please make sure to put the mooring pin inside the punt when going down the ramp! We don’t want to have to remove any more bent metal pins.</strong></li>
<li>Student I.D card or any I.D card (Alumni etc), must be left with the porter, once a punt key is taken out of the lodge.</li>
<li>Punts, kayaks, and paddle boards can be taken out from 08.00. Everything must be returned at the very latest 15 minutes before sunset.</li>
<li><strong>NO AFTER DARK PUNTING OR KAYAKING</strong> - only the Admiral can take boats out after dark or give permission to do so.</li>
<li>For students & college members with a raven log: <strong>all bookings need to be entered into the online booking system before the outing starts</strong> - no key can be given out without the online booking or the explicit consent of the Admiral of the Punts. If you don’t have a raven login (as an alumnus) please contact the Alumni Office to make your booking (see website) or request the porters to make the booking for you.</li>
<li>Make sure to check the punt, kayaks, and locks for any damage after the outing and report it both to the porter on duty <strong>AND</strong> the Admiral of the Punts <strong>immediately after returning</strong>. If something is damaged before the outing, go back and inform the porter and write the Admiral.</li>
<li>The person making the booking has to be present at all times during the outing and is responsible for the behaviour of their guests.</li>
<li>All punt, kayak, paddle board, and canoe hire (including safety equipment) is at the hirer’s own risk. The hirer warrants that both him/herself and all passengers have sufficient training/expertise for the outing (<strong>see the terms and conditions for more details on this!</strong>)</li>
<li>Don't be late when returning - you risk a suspension or fine (and how would you feel if you had to wait for other people to return)</li>
</ul>

<strong>IMPORTANT</strong> - to avoid damage to the boats
<ul>
<li>
Be extra careful with the metal pins when rolling the punt down the rollers on your trip to Grantchester. Make sure to put them inside the punt and do not keep them inside the hole! They might get bent otherwise.
</li>
<li>
Make sure to pull up the rudder on the kayaks when they are out of the water to avoid damage to the rudder. When in the water let the rudder down to make it easier to steer them.
</li>
</ul>
<a href="{{site.baseurl | absolute_url}}/documents/PuntClub-Notices.pdf">This document</a> has more details and explanations on how to avoid common errors.<br><br><br>

<h4 id="bookings">Bookings</h4>

<p align="justify">
Current members of the college, including staff, and alumni can book a single punt for a single outing of up to 3h each day. Punt Club members can book punts for free. Only members can book the canoe or the double kayak or up to two single kayaks or two paddle boards for 3h each day.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Bookings can be made on the day, or up to seven days in advance, and are allocated on a first-come, first-served basis. Each person is permitted to make one reservation per day lasting 3 hours. Weekends are the busiest and booking in advance is strongly recommended. During the week you will usually be able to take a punt out without booking in advance - but it is still recommended to avoid disappointment.
<strong>
For students & college members with a raven login (CRSid): all bookings need to be made before the outing starts via the online booking system.
</strong></p>

<p align="justify">
Trips down The Backs (to Jesus Green and back) typically take between a couple of hours depending on punting experience. Trips to Grantchester and back take 4 to 5 hours on average. As a consequence, the fee for punt trips to Grantchester is equivalent to two outings per punt or you need at least two members to make the journey; The latest time vessels can be taken out is one hour before sunset and
<strong>
all vessels must be returned and moored before sunset.
</strong></p>

<p align="justify">
<strong>For longer trips to Grantchester, if multiple punts are required or other non-standard bookings please contact the Admiral of the Punts.
</strong></p>

<a href="http://dcsa.dar.cam.ac.uk/booked/Web">Link to the online booking system</a>


<h5>For alumni without a raven log in</h5>
<p align="justify">
Alumni must contact the College Development Office at <a href="alumni.relations@darwin.cam.ac.uk">alumni.relations@darwin.cam.ac.uk</a> who will be able to make the booking in your place. Same-day bookings can be made in person at the porters’ lodge, but we strongly advise you to make the reservation to avoid disappointments.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Chauffeured punt tour services with experienced student punt captains are available. The cost per tour is £30 for punt club members or £40 for non- punt club members and is bookable by current college members and alumni. Please contact the Admiral of the punts by email at least one to two weeks in advance of your desired tour date.
</p><br>

<h4 id="activities-and-events">Activities and Events</h4>

<p align="justify">
Punting has a long tradition in Cambridge and is one of the highlights of what the town has to offer. In addition to being able to take your friends and family out when they visit, membership also gives you the opportunity to sign up to special events such as the annual Punt Race, the outings to the Trinity and St John’s May Ball fireworks at night, and to see King‘s choir‘s singing on the river. We will also chauffeur you to some fancy formals, teach you about bats that live in the area around Grantchester, or just have an enjoyable time in summer on a trip to the Grantchester orchard. Many of the pictures you can see at the top of this section have been taken during some of these events. It’s great fun and a good way to experience some of the unique aspects of Cambridge life.
</p><br>



<h4 id="first-outing">First outing - what you need to know</h4>

<p align="justify">
A small number of life jackets are available if desired and can be found in the same cupboards as the cushions (left side of the kayak house) and on the hangers. You are required to use them when using the kayaks and canoe.
</p><br>

<strong>Where is the equipment?</strong>
<p align="justify">
All equipment (life jackets, punt cushions, punt poles, spare paddle in case you drop the pole (more useful than you think) can be found in our new kayak house, just next to the Old Granary.
</p>
<a href="{{site.baseurl | absolute_url}}/images/puntshow/KayakHouseLocation.png"><img src="{{site.baseurl | absolute_url}}/images/puntshow/KayakHouseLocation.png" alt="[Kayak House Location]" width="300px"/></a>
<br>

<strong>How to lock a punt?</strong>
<p align="justify">
This is a tricky one. <a href="{{site.baseurl | absolute_url}}/documents/PuntClub-Notices.pdf">This document</a> has some information on how to do it. Punts need to be moored at both ends. Do NOT chain one punt to another punt – this creates problems when someone tries to take that punt out. Wrap the chain around the post as often as possible to restrict the movement of the locked-up punts against the concrete walls. But make sure not to lock them too rigidly, so the next person can still use them with ease, even if they are not as strong as you.
</p><br>

<strong>What is bailing?</strong>
<p align="justify">
If you are using the punts after a period of rain, keep in mind that they are likely to contain water! There should be a bucket or bailer at the quay to bail out the water (looks like a blue dustpan). Don't take the bailer with you on the river!
</p><br>

<strong>What if I am late?</strong>
<p align="justify">
Always try to keep to the allotted time. Late-comers risk suspension from the Punt Club. This is particularly important in the evening, never arrive back after dark. In case you are more than 15min late, please make sure to call and inform the Porters’ Lodge at 01223 335660.
</p><br>

<strong>What to do before returning the keys?</strong>
<p align="justify">
Make sure the punts are properly locked. Keep the punts tidy and take any rubbish with you. Return all equipment to where you got it from. If something gets damaged or lost during an outing, report it to the Porter on duty <strong>AND</strong> the Admiral of the Punts as soon as possible. This allows people with later reservations to be notified if there is a problem and will save you a lot of trouble.
</p><br>

<strong>How to steer a punt?</strong>
<p align="justify">
We have a complete <a href="{{site.baseurl | absolute_url}}/documents/PuntGuide.pdf">guide</a> on the topic, but then the best way of learning is probably by doing. The club runs free punting lessons throughout Freshers’ Fortnight at the start of the academic year and these are the best opportunity to learn the basics of punting on the Cam.
We might also offer lessons at other times of the year if there is sufficient demand, so please contact the Admiral of the Punts if you are interested.
</p><br>

<strong>How to make a booking?</strong>
<p align="justify">
To book, log in to the portal to see the availability of the vessels. To make a booking, click on an available time slot. The ‘Create a new reservation’ page will then open. Enter your chosen time, under name of booking enter your full name and CRSID eg John Doe (jd42), then ‘Create’. The booking should then appear under the schedule, payment (in case of single outing, we accept only cashless payments) must be made when you arrive at the porter’s lodge to pick up the keys at the start of the booking.
</p><br>
