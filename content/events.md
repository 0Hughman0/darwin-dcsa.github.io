  <summary><strong>BOP at Darwin</strong></summary>

BOP ON at Darwin! We have ALL you need: music, dancing, alcohol and of course, friends.
<br><br>

A "BOP" is a Big Organised Party which is organised by Entertainments Officers. It usually involves live bands, DJs, and good times. Sometimes we’ll have extra entertainment like glitter, ceilidhs and karaoke. Some of the highlights of the BOP calendar include:
<br><br>

<ul>
<li>The Fresher’s BOP, where we welcome all of the new Darwinians at the start of the year. This event is a perfect chance to get to know people in and out of Darwin. It is completely normal to greet strangers at Darbar, on the dance floor or even in the corridor.
</li>

<li>The themed BOPs, namely Halloween and Christmas, where everyone is encouraged to costume up and enjoy some traditional activities such as carving a pumpkin or kissing under the mistletoe.
</li>

<li>The May Ball launch BOP, where we reveal the May Ball theme for the year. This is considered to be the biggest BOP of the year, involves lots of decorations, a wide range of drinks and a ton of great music entertainment.
</li>
</ul>

Open your mind, open a bottle of wine and immerse yourself in the best BOPs in Cambridge.

<br><br>
ID POLICY FOR BOPS (Updated 18/11/16)
<br><br>

Darwin students must bring their student card to gain entry.
<br><br>

If you have managed to secure a ticket to bring a guest you must accompany your guest in order for them to gain entry to the BOP. Cambridge University students can bring their student card (showing their College affiliation). Everyone else must bring government issued photographic ID showing their date of birth (such as passport/driving license).
<br><br>

There is a maximum capacity for BOPs, which means we need to monitor how many people are present at any given time. This may mean if you leave the BOP for an extended period of time you risk not gaining entry again. (Why would you want to leave for an extended period of time anyway?!) If you have reserved a ticket and arrive by 23.00 you will be guaranteed entry. If you have not arrived by 23.00 you risk not gaining entry, as we will resell your ticket, assuming you are not coming. If you know you will arrive after 23.00 please inform the DCSA when you buy your ticket or contact the Ents Officers.
<br><br>

There is a zero tolerance policy for aggressive behaviour. If you display any level of aggressive behaviour you will be asked to leave and security will remove you if necessary. You risk being banned from all future Darwin BOPs, should this happen.
<br><br>

Everyone will be asked to leave the BOP at 1am.

  <summary><strong>Darwin May Ball</strong></summary>

The Darwin May Ball is an annual fixture on the last friday of May Week (which happens to be in June), held on the central site of Darwin College. Stretching from Mill pond to Silver Street, our unique site - we are the only college with an island - is transformed for one night into a kaliedoscope of colour.
<br><br>

This year the ball will run from sunset to sunrise. Guests enter at 9pm (or earlier, if Q-Jump or VIP), and the ball finishes at 5am, after the survivors' photo.
<br><br>

  <summary><strong>Darwin-Wolfson(Oxford) Sport Day</strong></summary>

Like most Cambridge Colleges, Darwin is twinned with a sister College at Oxford, Wolfson, which is also a Graduate College. There is an annual Sports Day held in the Lent term which is organised by the DCSA Sports and Societies Officers, where one College hosts the other in alternate years. A whole day of fun activities are planned, including pub and sightseeing tours of Oxford, ending with a special guest night formal dinner and a BOP in the Wolfson Bar.
