They also worked with the Events Officer to host other events throughout the year. Darwin BOPs were known for their vibrant atmosphere and original themes and they always had the most popular Cambridge bands performing. Sadly BOPs are not allowed in the foreseable future. They will now try their best to offer alternative entertainments. But rest assured, as soon as BOPs are allowed again, they will throw the best and biggest college parties which will have been worth the wait! Think live music, themes, drinks, djs, raffles, good vibes and dancing until the early morning... Reach out to them if you have any ideas! One officer is elected in November, and the other is elected in May.
