Joining the University of Cambridge and Darwin College is a huge accomplishment, so congratulations on this incredible achievement! Darwin College was founded in 1964 and was the first Cambridge College to only admit graduates and to admit both men and women. Today Darwin has around 650 students and admits around 250 new students every year from all over world and from a variety of subject areas. Being in Cambridge will provide you with many opportunities to expand your knowledge, skill set, and friendship group. The DCSA wants to provide you as many chances as possible to take advantage of this and to network within college.
